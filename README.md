# Picture Map Matching

Guess were a set of pictures was shot !

-- Work in progress --

As a student from [le Wagon](http://www.lewagon.org) bootcamp, this game had an educationnal goal : learn to deal with apis and especially google map api.

If you want to play the game you need to insert your google api-key and flickr api key in the code (see requirements). I'm currently working on a module to make it automated.


## Requirements

So what do you need to build a game with this solution ?
(You do not need to have a flickr/yahoo account to get an api key for the photos.search feature of flickr api)

* A browser
* A google map api key from [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key)
* A flickr key API from [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search)
